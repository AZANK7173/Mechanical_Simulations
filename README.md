# Simulações Mecanicas / Mechanical Simulations
Repository of mechanical simulations developted for Mechatronics Engineering Degree. 

* `massa_mola`: analysis of a spring damper system using the Gauss Method for determining this.

* `vigas`: matlab code used to determine the vibration modes from a framewoerk of beams using the Finite Element Method

* See also termical simulations [here](https://github.com/arielguerreiro/PMR3401_EP1)
